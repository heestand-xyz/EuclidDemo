# RealityKit Bool Demo with Euclid

This demo is made in SwiftUI for iOS & macOS.

A demo subtracting RealityKit meshes with a bool operation using Euclid.

First a RealityKit MeshResource is converted to a Euclid Mesh, then the bool operation happens, then the Euclid Mesh is converted back to a RealityKit MeshResource.
